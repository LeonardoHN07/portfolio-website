        <h2> About Me: </h2>
        
        <p>I'm Jose Solano, Computer Science graduate from Florida State University. I have a passion for technology and programming, and I enjoy creating innovative solutions to complex problems. 
           I have experience in various programming languages including Python, Java, and C++. My main focus is working with artificial intelligence and machine learning, but I also have experience 
           in web development and software engineering. Throughout my academic career, I have worked on several projects that have allowed me to develop in depth skills in the area of NLP, data analysis, 
           virtual agents, training machine learning models, and web development.

                <p>Worked on both the backend and frontend for a semester long group project which consisted in creating a stock management
 application that tracks retail items, sends alerts when items are low on stock, updates items, tracks who made changes to the data
 stored, and provides analytics like most items sold, revenue and user interactions.

                <p>
                     Group project consisting on training a named entity recognition model to recognize entities in text such as people, locations, dates,
 events, geographical locations, products and currencies. Trained a blank spacy model to function specifically with texts related to
 travel and tourism. My contributions were developing and training the initial blank NER model. Read through the Spacy
 documentation to start the development of the project. Also developed a simpler version of the final project as a website.

                <h3> Power Automate Weather Bot Virtual Agent <button onclick="window.location.href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GV7PrDdkdkc2aMe47NIrEV9ZLZIOsseK/view'">Link to video demonstration</button> </h3>
                
                <p>
                     Using Microsoft Power Automate tools I created a weather bot with the capabilities of looking up a city and state by providing a zip
 code. Give you the weather forecast at an specific address and provide random weather facts when asked. The virtual agent was
 trained with prompts to ensure its user friendly and fun for all ages. The virtual agent uses cloud flows to be able to retrieve
 information when prompted.
