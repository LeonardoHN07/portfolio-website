        <h2> About Me: </h2>
        
        <p>I'm Jose Solano, Computer Science student at Florida State University, proud alumni from Hillsborough Community College. 
           Currently in my Senior year, my academic journey has been filled with great experiences, getting to meet and interact with professionals, 
           other passionate students and teaching faculty that have all contributed to shaping me into someone with a high level of commitment, responsibility,
           and understanding on what it takes to have a fulfilling and successful career within whats possible around the Computer Science program. Starting from small projects like
           a simple calculator program, to creating and training complex Natural Language Recognition models to detect and classify text. Having taken a wide range of electives from Theory of 
           Artificial Intelligence, Theory and structure of Databases, Advanced Java, Low Code Development and many other courses I believe I can prove my interest and commitment to recruiters and employers of my skills. 
           In this webpage you will you will learn some of my skills like languages, libraries, tools, demos of some of the most notable projects I have developed and contributed to.

                <h3> Retail Clothing Stock Manager  <button onclick="window.location.href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w45mpYUdfuQmk8awCmbGKaUBde514Yrkb7nQRLaTYvI/edit?usp=sharing'">Link to documentation</button></h3>
                <p>Worked on both the backend and frontend for a semester long group project which consisted in creating a stock management
 application that tracks retail items, sends alerts when items are low on stock, updates items, tracks who made changes to the data
 stored, and provides analytics like most items sold, revenue and user interactions.

                <p>
                     Group project consisting on training a named entity recognition model to recognize entities in text such as people, locations, dates,
 events, geographical locations, products and currencies. Trained a blank spacy model to function specifically with texts related to
 travel and tourism. My contributions were developing and training the initial blank NER model. Read through the Spacy
 documentation to start the development of the project. Also developed a simpler version of the final project as a website.

                <h3> Power Automate Weather Bot Virtual Agent <button onclick="window.location.href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GV7PrDdkdkc2aMe47NIrEV9ZLZIOsseK/view'">Link to video demonstration</button> </h3>
                
                <p>
                     Using Microsoft Power Automate tools I created a weather bot with the capabilities of looking up a city and state by providing a zip
 code. Give you the weather forecast at an specific address and provide random weather facts when asked. The virtual agent was
 trained with prompts to ensure its user friendly and fun for all ages. The virtual agent uses cloud flows to be able to retrieve
 information when prompted.
